We will be looking to test that our app is able to do the following:

<!--
- Render without crashing

- Render two default ToDo items

- Render an input field for typing up new ToDo items

- Render an ‘Add’ button for adding ToDo items

- If the ‘Add’ button is pressed but the input field is empty, prevent a new ToDo item from being created

- If the ‘Add’ button is pressed but the input field is empty, show an alert to the user

- If the ‘Add’ button is pressed and the input field has content, add a new ToDo item

- When the ‘Delete’ button is pressed for a single ToDo item, remove that ToDo item from the App

- From the two default items in ToDo, if the first ToDo item has been removed from the app, the second item should now become the first (and only) item.

- For the data being passed down from ToDo to ToDoItem as props, each ToDoItem should render the text that was passed down to it.

- Each ToDoItem should render a ‘Delete’ button.
