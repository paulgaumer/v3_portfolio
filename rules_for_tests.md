We will be looking to test that our app is able to do the following:

## HOMEPAGE

- Render Gatsby App without crashing

- Render an h1 with my name

- Render a short bio

- Render an image

- Render an internal link navigating to "Portfolio"
- If the link is clicked, window navigates to "#portfolio"

- Render and internal link navigating to "About"
- If the link is clicked, window navigates to "/about"

- Render and internal link navigating to "Blog"
- If the link is clicked, window navigates to "/blog"

## PORTFOLIO

- Render the section title called Portfolio

- Render a card title

- Render a card description

- Render a card link to project url

- Render a card back image

- Render a card front image

- Number of rendered nodes matches the number of elements passed as a prop (project list)
